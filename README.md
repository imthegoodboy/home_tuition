## üöÄ Deploying to Render (both frontend + backend)

You can deploy this repository to Render in two ways:

1) Single Web Service (recommended for simplicity): Build the React app during Render's build, and serve the static files from Express.
2) Two services (more scalable): Deploy the frontend as a Static Site and the backend as a Web Service.

Below are step-by-step instructions for the single-web-service approach (fastest):

### Single Web Service (build & serve)

1. In the root of this repository we've added a `postinstall` script that builds the client during the Render build step. This means the server will serve `client/build` when `NODE_ENV=production`.

2. Files changed / important scripts:
- `package.json` (root): contains `postinstall` to build client and `start:render` to run the server in production.
- `server/index.js`: serves static `client/build` when NODE_ENV=production.

3. Create a new Web Service on Render:
	- Connect your GitHub repository.
	- Build Command: npm install
	- Start Command: npm run start:render
	- Environment: set `NODE_ENV=production` and set `MONGODB_URI` (use MongoDB Atlas connection string) and `JWT_SECRET`.

4. Add Environment Variables on Render (in the service settings):
	- MONGODB_URI (required) e.g. mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
	- JWT_SECRET (required) a long secret string
	- PORT (optional) default 5000

5. Deploy. Render will run `npm install`, which triggers `postinstall` -> builds the React app into `client/build`. The server will then run with `NODE_ENV=production` and serve the build.

### Two-Service approach (preferred for production)

1. Frontend (Static Site on Render):
	- Create a Static Site -> Connect repo -> Root Directory: `client`
	- Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
	- Publish Directory: `client/build`

2. Backend (Web Service on Render):
	- Create a Web Service -> Connect repo -> Root Directory: `/`
	- Build Command: `cd server && npm install`
	- Start Command: `cd server && npm run start` (or `npm run dev` for development)
	- Environment variables: `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`

3. Set the frontend to point to the backend API URL (Render provides a service URL). In `client/package.json`, remove or override the `proxy` in development. For production builds, the client should call full API URLs or use a runtime config variable. A simple approach is to set an environment variable at build time and replace API base URL.

### Notes & recommended changes for hosting on Render
- Ensure `server/.env` is NOT checked into source. Use Render's environment variables.
- The root `postinstall` will install client dependencies and build the React app which slightly increases build time but makes single-service deployment easy.
- If you prefer separate services (best practice), deploy the frontend as a Static Site and backend as Web Service and use the backend URL in client API requests.

### Quick checklist before deploy
- Commit and push the repository to GitHub.
- Make sure `server/scripts/initData.js` (seed) is not run automatically in production. Run it manually if you need seeded data.
- Configure your MongoDB Atlas network access (allow Render's IPs or use 0.0.0.0/0 during testing).
- Add `JWT_SECRET` and `MONGODB_URI` in Render's Environment settings.

If you want, I can:
- Add a small runtime config to inject REACT_APP_API_URL during build so the client talks to the deployed backend URL.
- Provide exact Render dashboard screenshots and field values for each step (if you want a guided walkthrough).


### 5. Authentication
- Role-based access (Student/Teacher/Admin)
- Secure JWT authentication
- Form validation
- Password hashing

## üîí Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Environment variable protection

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
- Various screen sizes

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
1. Build the React app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `client/build` folder

### Backend Deployment (Heroku/Railway)
1. Set environment variables
2. Deploy the `server` folder
3. Configure MongoDB Atlas for production

### Database
- Use MongoDB Atlas for production
- Update `MONGODB_URI` in environment variables
